# GravitySimulator
A simple gravity simulator.

It can simulate multiple objects of different masses and trace their paths.

To add an object to the simulation, click on the the `ADD_OBJECT` button and drag the object onto the sandbox. You can click on any object to select it. This is represented by a circle around the object. When selected, you can view the properties of and object, as well as edit them. The `TRACING` button toggles tracing.
